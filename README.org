#+DESCRIPTION: Tile-based 2D video game map editor
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

A Lisp/CLIM-based editor for 2D video game maps.

Similar to [[https://www.mapeditor.org/][Tiled]] but hopefully the map format will be simpler to use (at least for Lisp-based games).

Obviously, hugely a work in progress and not really recommended for use by anyone at this point.
